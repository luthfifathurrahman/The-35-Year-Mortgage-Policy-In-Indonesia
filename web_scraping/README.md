# Web Scraping

## Overview

This directory contains Python scripts for web scraping various websites using the Selenium library. The purpose of these scripts is to extract specific data from external websites. The focus is on retrieving information such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, land area, built-up area, location, and price.

## Prerequisites

- Python programming language
- Selenium library

## Setup

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install Selenium: You can install the Selenium library using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install webdriver-manager
   ```

## Code Details

The code in the script performs the following tasks:

- Logs the process during data extraction.
